SpotYou is a web application written in React using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
and  [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).  The Spotify and Youtube APIs are leveraged
to allow a user to select a Spotify playlist that they have either created or
subscribed to, and then watch music  videos for each song in the playlist.

I used the following gatsby starter: https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind
